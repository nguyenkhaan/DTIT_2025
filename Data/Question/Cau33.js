When questioned, the lawyer admitted they hadn't cross-checked the references. They assumed the system's confidence meant accuracy.
Later, an AI ethics researcher commented, *"This isn't just a data issue. The model isn't lying - it's doing something much more complex, and dangerous, known as __________."*
